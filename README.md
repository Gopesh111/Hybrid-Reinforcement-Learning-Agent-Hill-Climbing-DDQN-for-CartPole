Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Agent – Hill Climbing + DDQN for CartPole
Python, NumPy, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Matplotlib, Pygame

1)Developed a hybrid reinforcement learning framework combining Hill Climbing and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to solve the CartPole-v1 control problem.

2)Implemented policy optimization using Hill Climbing and integrated it to prefill DDQN replay memory, improving convergence speed.

3)Built Q-network architectures with PyTorch, implemented epsilon-greedy exploration, and applied target network updates for stable training.

4)Utilized OpenAI Gym for environment simulation, Matplotlib for reward/accuracy visualization, and Pygame for live agent rendering.

5)Achieved significant performance improvements — faster convergence and higher average accuracy compared to standalone methods.
