Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Agent – Hill Climbing + DDQN for CartPole
Python, NumPy, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Matplotlib, Pygame

Developed a hybrid reinforcement learning framework combining Hill Climbing and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to solve the CartPole-v1 control problem.

Implemented policy optimization using Hill Climbing and integrated it to prefill DDQN replay memory, improving convergence speed.

Built Q-network architectures with PyTorch, implemented epsilon-greedy exploration, and applied target network updates for stable training.

Utilized OpenAI Gym for environment simulation, Matplotlib for reward/accuracy visualization, and Pygame for live agent rendering.

Achieved significant performance improvements — faster convergence and higher average accuracy compared to standalone methods.
